        <h2>Target description</h2>
        <p>This weather network will be available to those people who are in Eastern Idaho and are looking for up to date information about their surroundings and the forecast for their future.</p>
        <h2>Two Personas</h2>
        <p>Here is the description of Steve and Alex. Steve is a middle aged man who works about 3 cities away from where he lives, even though it is a 20 minute commute he likes to know which way will be able to give him a faster route to work. Alex is a young woman who loves going sight seeing and has had a recent interest in Eastern Idaho as it is not far from her hometown on the west side of Idaho. She will be looking at the small towns that give the most homely feel and have the greatest hospitality.
